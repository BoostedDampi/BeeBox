# :bee: BeeBox & BeeManager :bee:

## Description

This is my personal Remote Bee Hive weight monitoring system. 

It is made from **two** parts:

- **BeeBox**:
It works with an Arduino and a Scale which act like a server trough a SimCOM 800l GSM module, I programmed the arduino for power efficiency but you will need some form of power supply o battery.\
After I finish the project I will test if the Arduino can run indefinitely with a solar panel or not.
- **BeeManager** or **BeeMan**:
The BeeMan client must be installed on a server (like a Raspberry Pi) on your home LAN, no port forwarding is needed!\
The BeeManager will open a website on which to see the data trough a graph, you will also have the possibility to Config the BeeBox trough the site.

## To-Do

- [x] BeeManager Socket. :satellite:
- [ ] BeeManager Database. :open_file_folder: (Working on this now).


- [ ] BeeManager Webserver. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- [ ] BeeManager Main application. :desktop_computer:<br/>
- [x] BeeBox Proof of work. :gear:
- [ ] BeeBox socket and security features :satellite:.
- [ ] BeeBox Power management. :battery:
- [ ] Wiring and upload of schematics (I'm a CS student, I'm going to learn this when finished programming the rest).<br/>
- [ ] Getting harshly insulted by a Bee. 
- [ ] Getting stung by a Bee while installing the BeeBox. :bee:

## Do you want to help?

Wow thatâ€™s very nice, but before you start investing time in my project think about the fact that there are 10e9999 better projects not made by a CS student making shitty implementation decisions.\
I know they are shitty because i made them.\
But any critique is highly welcomed!making shitty implementation decisions.\
