## BeeBox & BeeManager

> Bzzzzzz... -Bob the Bee

# Description

This is my personal Remote Bee Hive weight monitoring system. 

It is made from **two** parts:

- **BeeBox**
It works with an Arduino and a GSM module which acts like a server, i programmed the arduino for power efficiency but you will need some form of power supply, when finished the project i will test if i can run the Arduino indefinitely with a solar panel.
- **BeeManager** or **BeeMan**
The BeeMan client must be installed on a server (like a Raspberry Pi) on your home LAN, no port forwarding is needed.
The BeeManager will open a website on which to see the data.

# To-Do

- [x] BeeManager Socket.
- [ ] BeeManager Database (Working on this now).\

- [ ] BeeManager Webserver.
- [ ] BeeManager Main application.\

- [x] BeeBox Proof of work.
- [ ] BeeBox socket and security features.
- [ ] BeeBox Power management.
- [ ] Wiring and upload of schematics (I'm a CS student, I'm going to learn this when finished programming the rest).\

- [ ] Getting stung by a Bee when installing the Box

# Do you want to help?

Wow thatâ€™s very nice, but before you start investing time in my project think about the fact that there are 10e9999 better projects not made by a CS student making shitty implementation decisions.\
I know they are shitty because i made them.\
But any critique is highly welcomed!
